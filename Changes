Revision history for 'Test-Approx' Perl module
----------------------------------------------

All changes by Steve Purkis, unless otherwise noted.

0.04
    +	Profiled, benchmarked & optimized.  Now almost twice as fast on an AMD
	Opteron 2GHz CPU.  Got two main performance fixes in:
	1. Brought distance() calcs into 1 function & cached lots of stuff.
	2. Brought compute_level() calcs inline.
    *	Calculate zoom level breaks on encode() in case its deps have changed.
    *	Fixed a bad bug in the distance calculation (it would always find that
	'I' was interior to line seg AB, even when it was not, resulting in
	incorrect distance calcs!)

0.03
    +	added missing dep on accessors [reported by CPAN Testers]

0.02
    +	cleaned up & released

0.01
    +	created Thurs Apr 24 2008
